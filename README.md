# Scheduling and Job Assignment Algorithms üìÖüõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains implementations of scheduling algorithms with deadlines and job assignments using various approaches.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Scheduling with Deadlines:** Optimizing task order to maximize profit within deadlines.
- **Disjoint Set Scheduling:** Utilizing disjoint set data structures for efficient task management.
- **Job Assignments:** Assigning jobs to individuals using greedy and dynamic programming approaches.

## Algorithms

### Scheduling with Deadlines
- **Description:** Sorts jobs by profit and schedules them within their deadlines for maximum profit.
- **Output:** Displays optimal job sequence and total profit.

### Disjoint Set Scheduling
- **Description:** Uses disjoint set data structures to efficiently manage and schedule tasks by deadlines.
- **Output:** Shows optimal task scheduling with maximum profit.

### Job Assignments
- **Greedy Approach:** Assigns jobs to individuals to minimize cost using a greedy algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Finds the optimal job assignments to minimize costs using dynamic programming.
- **Output:** Displays job assignments with corresponding costs and total minimal cost.
